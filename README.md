# Check my DrinksApp
## If it ain't broke, it's a miracle

This is an app that...
  - takes people and takes drinks up to a database.
  - then from this you can make drink rounds, which are recorded for future reference.

        Select an option from the list:
        [G]et all people
        [A]dd a person
        [D]rinks menu
        [R]ound builder
        [V]iew round
        [E]xit
